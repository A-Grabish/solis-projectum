The questions?

What is solar activity?

Sunspots are dark, cool spots on the Sun.  Strong magnetic fields keep the heat from reaching the solar surface.  These spots of shade are still host, around 6,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

The are the Think of them as caps to a magnetic storm that is brewing just below the solar surface. The Sun's magnetic fields are moving around, getting twisted and concentrated in these regions.


What is the solar cycle?

The number of sunspots will increase and decrease over time in a regular, approximately over an 11-year period, called the solar cycle.

The highest number of sunspots in any given cycle is called the "solar maximum".  After some years of high activity, the Sun will ramp down with fewer sunspots to almost no sunspots. When it reaches its lowest number of sunspots, that is "solar minimum".


Periods of extreme cold winter weather can be linked to the solar cycle.

The Maunder Minimum 
Times of depressed solar activity seem to correspond with times of global cold. Between 1645 and 1715, know as "The Maunder Minimum" there were only about 50 sunspots instead of the usual 40 to 50 thousand.  This lead to cold and harsh winters.  In London, the Thames would regullary freeze and there was ice skating. In New York would harbor froze and people would walk from Manhattan to Staten Island.  For 70 years, temperatures dropped by 1.8 to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.
